#+description: Glossary of all possible configuration options for Neruda

This file explain all possible configuration options for Neruda, which
may be put in file named ~config.yml~ at the root of your static website
project. The options are listed in alphabetical order. However, they can
be put in any order in the ~config.yml~ file.

* ~author~

The ~author~ option stores the default author name of your org
files. This value is used when you create a new file. *It is not used by
the regular org mode publishing process*. You must be sure that your org
files contains an ~#+author:~ metadata field before publishing them.

This value is used in the generation of the blog index page and the main
atom feed.

* ~blog_path~
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: sec-blog_path
:END:

The ~blog_path~ options store the folder name *inside* the ~src~ folder,
which will contains org document to be specifically indexed to produce a
blog-like website.

Neruda will introspect the org documents inside this folder in order to
find keywords (declared with the ~#+keywords:~ header) and produce as
many new time-sorted indexes for these keywords, plus a specific index
page at the root of this folder.

The default value is ~blog~.

* ~blog_pattern~
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: sec-blog_pattern
:END:

The ~blog_pattern~ option stores a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glob_(programming)][glob pattern]] to help Neruda to find
the documents you want to index under the [[#sec-blog_path][~blog_path~]] folder. It may be
handy to only selecte precisely some files. The default value is
~**/*.org~, which means absolutely all org documents (under the
~blog_path~).

See also the [[#sec-exclude_pattern][~exclude_pattern~ section]].

* ~domain~

The domain name pointing to where your static website is expected to be
hosted. This value is used to generate absolute path to your files on
your expected host name (for example in the Atom feeds). Its value is
expected to *not* end by a slash. That is to say ~https://example.com~
is a *valid* value, while ~https://example.com/~ is not. Its default
value is an empty string.

By default, your static website is expected to be hosted at the root of
your domain name (like ~https://example.com/index.html~). If it is not
the case and your neruda static website is hosted in a sub directory of
your main website, you must add this sub folder to the ~domain~
value. Thus, ~https://example.com/example~ or
~https://example.com/complex/example~ are *valid* values too, while
~https://example.com/example/~ or ~https://example.com/complex/example/~
are not.

* ~exclude_pattern~
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: sec-exclude_pattern
:END:

The ~exclude_pattern~ option stores a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression][regular expression]] to help Neruda
to find precisely which files you want to index under the [[#sec-blog_path][~blog_path~]]
folder. It may be handy to remove some unrelated data files, for example
with a value like ~comments\.org$~. This filter is executed *after*
files have been selected by the [[#sec-blog_pattern][~blog_pattern~]] and *matching* files are
excluded.

There is no default value (thus nothing match and thus all org files
matched by the ~blog_pattern~ option are indexed).

See also the [[#sec-blog_pattern][~blog_pattern~ section]].

* ~lang~

The main locale your website will be written in. Its value must comply
with the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes][ISO 639-1]] standard.

* ~public_folder~

The ~public_folder~ option stores the path to the folder, which will
contains the generated files, ready for publication. It's default value
is ~public_html~ (at the root of your project).

* ~remote~

The ~remote~ option contains an /rsync/ like destination string, which
will be used to published your website when using the ~sync:push~ /rake/
task. For exemple ~user@domain:/var/www/mywebsite/~

* ~title~

The ~title~ option stores the default title of your org files. This value
is used when you create a new file. *It is not used by the regular org
mode publishing process*. You must be sure that your org files contains
an ~#+title:~ metadata field before publishing them.

This value is used in the generation of the blog index page and the main
atom feed.
